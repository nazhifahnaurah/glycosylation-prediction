In this study, there are 2 types of data: independent data and benchmark data. The features used include extraction features such as AAindex, CTD, Sable, PseAAC, Hydrophobicity, and selection features using Maximum Redundancy Minimum Relevance (MRMR). The classification testing used SVM with 5-fold cross validation. The highest accuracy result was achieved using the MRMR feature selection method with 75 columns.

For independent data N, the highest accuracy was achieved using the sigmoid kernel with an accuracy of 86.66%. For independent data C, the accuracy was 87.5% with the sigmoid kernel, and for independent data O, the highest accuracy of 89.31% was achieved with the RBF kernel.

In the case of benchmark data, for N, the highest accuracy achieved was 70.54% with the RBF kernel. For benchmark data C, the highest accuracy of 95.06% was achieved with the RBF kernel, and for benchmark data O, the highest accuracy was 92.64%, also with the RBF kernel.
